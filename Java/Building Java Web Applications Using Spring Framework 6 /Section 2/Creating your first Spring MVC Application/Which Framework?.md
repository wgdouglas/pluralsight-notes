# Which Framework?

---

Frameworks are essential for building web applications. They provide a structured way to develop applications, making it easier to manage complexity and maintain code. In this section, we will compare different frameworks and discuss their pros and cons.
- **Spring Framework**: A powerful and flexible framework for building Java applications. It provides a wide range of features, including dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and support for various data access technologies. Spring is known for its modularity and can be used for both web and non-web applications.
- **Spring Boot**: A lightweight framework built on top of the Spring Framework. It simplifies the process of building and deploying Spring applications by providing a set of conventions and defaults. Spring Boot is designed for microservices and cloud-native applications, making it easy to create standalone applications with minimal configuration.
- **XML**: A markup language used for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is often used for data interchange between systems and can be used in conjunction with various frameworks.

Here we will understand that this application will not be using XML for configuration. Instead, we will use Java annotations and Spring Boot to configure our application. This approach simplifies the configuration process and makes it easier to manage dependencies.
- However, if you are curious about using XML for configuration, you can refer to the Spring documentation for more information. The documentation of the old course of this in pluralsight still provides detailed examples and explanations of how to use XML for configuring Spring applications.
